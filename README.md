# Quality System Playbook (Senior QA)

This repo shows how I approach QA in fast-moving product teams: risk-first coverage, pragmatic automation, and release confidence based on signal.

## What’s inside
- **Quality model:** how I map risk and define “quality” in a product context
- **BDD examples:** Gherkin scenarios written as shared language (QA ↔ Product ↔ Engineering)
- **Checklists:** release readiness, smoke/regression, and incident learning
- **CI signal principles:** how to keep automation reliable and useful

## Context
Created as a lightweight sample for a Senior QA Engineer role focused on:
- risk-based testing
- Playwright + BDD-style workflows
- CI/CD signal and release confidence
- production learning (incidents → prevention)

> Notes on tooling: My Playwright experience is primarily through a low-code layer/add-on. The focus here is on **test intent, structure, and signal**, not framework engineering.
