# Incident learning checklist

- What was the user impact? (trust/correctness/permissions/performance)
- What signal existed? (logs, metrics, alerts, support tickets)
- Repro steps + environment notes
- Fix validation steps
- Preventative action:
  - add/adjust smoke or regression coverage
  - update runbook/monitoring
  - clarify product behaviour/requirements
